# Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1802 [Hard]

## Problem Statement

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

Given a list of words,
find all pairs of unique indices such that the concatenation of the two
words is a palindrome.

For example, given the list
["code", "edoc", "da", "d"],
return [(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 3)].

## Analysis

Doesn't provide any limits, like "O(n)" time, or "O(1)" additional space.

The example gives extra info, "(0, 1)" and "(1, 0)" indicate
they want you to find "codeedoc" and "edoccode".
